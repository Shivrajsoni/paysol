# Paysol

- i wann'a create a site which stores user contact's like what'sapp and publickey of them , so that
- we can pay them via their name remembering not their publicKey
- add scanner for payment also , which directs to user payment , only we need to add the amount in it ,
- add group payment's also means , i can pay more than one people at a time with ease
- implmenting priority fee model which will confirm the transaction at any status by taking some charges

## STEPS

- First step is to make transaction enable
- Now next step is to Make a database ans store user transaction detail , and allow to transact user via Name's

  Day 1

  - for this firstly i have created design of database :
  - add login functionality also
  - now , I will design the api's such as :

    - creating a New user, -done
    - creating a contact, -done
    - sending transaction, -done
    - indexing all contacts, -done

    Day 2

  - Now i will make contact page more interactive ,some implementations :
    - when we click contact on a icon , automatically a pay button creates for that contact
    - and after that make recent transaction tracking page for user
    - add framer and making it more optimize
    - also a option for requesting payment to user

  Future Plans :
  A group Payment Mechanism

  - where user can add people and form group , a common account will be created to the group and
  - then can deposit fund their and after that suppose anybody can purchase from that group account by multisignature of the users in the group

### Questions :

    - how can i add solana tokens in user wallet by taking payments from them , like an exchange for usd ?
